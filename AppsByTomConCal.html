	<br>
	<br>
<strong>How To Use Construction Calculator</strong>
<br>

<p>The Main Page is divided in such a way as to allow you to choose a function from the following options: Calculator, Converter, and Formulas.</p>
 <br>

<strong><h3>Calculator</h3></strong>
<p>This option will allow you to enter numbers and perform operations ( add, subtract, multiply, and divide) on them.  You will have the option of entering whole numbers, fractions, or combinations.  You could for example perform the following 22 7/16 divided by 5/8 which will give you 35 9/10.  You will notice that there is no "=" key on the keyboard, the reason being that once you have entered <strong>both</strong> numbers to be used in the operation and press the operation to be performed, the operation will be performed and the result displayed.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Converter</h3></strong>

<p>This option will allow you to enter either a value in meters, centimeters, and millimeters or yards, feet, inches and fractions of inches and have the value converted.  You could for example enter 3 yards 1 foot 2 1/8, press the "Convert" button and the result  of 3 meters 10 centimeters and 1 millimeter will be displayed.  The convert function also allows for a conversion from metric to imperial by entering a metric value and then pressing 'Convert'.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Formulas</h3></strong>

<p>This button will take you to a menu where you can choose either metric or imperial.  The same formulas available for either choice, one works in metric while the other works in imperial.  The choices are 'Volume of slab/column/wall', 'Volume of a round column', 'Hypotenuse/pythagorean', and 'Hypotenuse/law of sin'.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Volume of slab/column/wall</h3></strong>

<p>This page will prompt you for three inputs 'l','w',and 'h'. Once you have entered all the values press the 'Calculate' button and the result will be displayed in either cubic yards or cubic meters depending on the section you are in (metric or imperial).  An image can be viewed for reference, via a button at the top of the page, which indicates the values required.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Volume of a round column</h3></strong>

<p>This page will prompt you for two inputs 'r', and 'h'.  As with 'Volume of slab/column/wall', once you have entered all the values press the 'Calculate' button and the result will be displayed in either cubic yards or cubic meters depending on the section you are in (metric or imperial).  An image can be viewed for reference, via a button at the top of the page, which indicates the values required.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Hypotenuse/pythagorean</h3></strong>

<p>This page will prompt you for two inputs 'Side a' and 'Side b'.  Once these values have been entered press the 'Calculate' button and the value for  'Side c'  will be displayed in either metric or imperial depending on the section you are in (metric or imperial).  An image can be viewed for reference, via a button at the top of the page, which indicates the values required.  It should be noted that this formula applies only to a right angle triangle ( the angle at 'c' being 90 degrees).</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Hypotenuse/law of sin</h3></strong>

<p>This page will prompt you for two inputs 'Angle at A' and 'Side a'.  Once these values have been entered press the 'Calculate' button and the value for  'Side c'  will be displayed in either metric or imperial depending on the section you are in (metric or imperial).  An image can be viewed for reference, via a button at the top of the page, which indicates the values required.  It should be noted that this formula applies only to a right angle triangle ( the angle at 'c' being 90 degrees).</p>
<br>


<center><strong><h3>Misc.</h3></strong></center>

<strong><h3>Clear and Clear All Buttons</h3></strong>

<p>These buttons are on all input pages.<br>  
The button labeled 'Clear' will clear the last digit in the active input field.  For example if you enter 1234 and had in fact intended to enter 1235, simply tap the input field where you made the error and press the 'Clear' button once to remove the last digit displayed, 123 will now be displayed, press '5' and you now have your desired input.<br>
The button labeled 'Clear All' will do just what it says and clear all fields, input and result.</p>
<br>

<strong><h3>Calculate Button</h3></strong>
<p>Press this button once you have entered the required inputs, the operation will be performed and the result displayed.</p>
<br>


<strong><h3>Active Input Field</h3></strong>

<p>The active input field is indicated by a dark blue, any input will be placed in this field.  To change where you put input just tap on the field where you wish to place the input and the dark blue will indicate the field chosen.</p>
