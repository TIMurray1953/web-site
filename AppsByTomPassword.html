	<h2>Password Maker</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
<strong>How To Use Password Maker</strong>
<br>

<p>The main page is divided to allow you to choose a password containing your choice of the following: all capital letters, a combination of capital and lower case letters, a combination of capital letters and numbers, all lower case letters, a combination of lower case letters and numbers, a combination of capital letters, lower case letters and numbers, or all numbers.</p>
 <br>

<p>When you select one of these options you will be taken to a page to enter the length of the password you want, and whether you want special characters included in the password or not. The special characters which may be chosen are: !, @, $, %, &, ? and #. If you will want to enter your password on a keyboard, keep in mind what can be entered on that keyboard – you may not be able to enter a special character. Once you have entered the length of password you want, press either the "Yes" button to have the password contain special characters or the "No" button for a password without special characters on Android devices.  On Apple devices enter the length of password you require, then use the slide switch to indicate whether you want to include special characters in the password. Press the "Generate Password" and as soon as you press the button your password will be generated.</p>
<br>

<p>Should you wish to copy and paste the resulting password use the "long click" on Android devices.  On Apple devices use "double click" to bring up the copy/paste buttons.</p>

<strong>Guidelines for strong passwords</strong>
<br><br>

The following is an extract from Wikipedia, presented here as a guide:<br>

Strong passwords are typically harder to discover by intelligent guessing. Common guidelines advocated by proponents of software system security include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Use a minimum password length of 12 to 14 characters if permitted.</li>
<li>Include lower case and upper case alphabetic characters, numbers and symbols if permitted.</li>
<li>Generate passwords randomly where feasible.</li>
<li>Avoid using the same password twice (e.g., across multiple user accounts and/or software systems).</li>
<li>Avoid character repetition, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, letter or number sequences, usernames, names of relatives or pet names, romantic links (current or past) and biographical information (e.g., ID numbers, ancestors' names or dates).</li>
<li>Avoid using information that is or might become publicly associated with the user or the account.</li>
<li>Avoid using information that the user's colleagues and/or acquaintances might know to be associated with the user.</li>
<li>Do not use passwords which consist wholly of any simple combination of the aforementioned weak components.</li>
<li>Some guidelines advise against writing passwords down, while others, noting the large numbers of password protected systems users must access, encourage writing down passwords as long as the written password lists are kept in a safe place, not attached to a monitor or in an unlocked desk drawer.</li>
</ul>
<br>

And from Connectsafely.org:<br>
<ul>
<li>Never give out your password to anyone.</li>
<li>Don’t just use one password.</li>
<li>Create passwords that are easy to remember but hard for others to guess.</li>
<li>Make the password at least 8 characters long.</li> 
<li>Include numbers, capital letters and symbols.</li>
<li>Don’t use dictionary words.</li>
<li>Don’t post it in plain sight.</li>
<li>Consider using a password manager.</li>
<li>Consider using multi-factor authentication.</li>
<li>Don’t fall for “phishing” attacks.</li> 
<li>Make sure your devices are secure.</li>
<li>Use a “password” or fingerprints for your phone too.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Note: The possible character set for a password can be constrained by different web sites or by the range of keyboards on which the password must be entered.<br>

The passwords generated by this app are not a guarantee of security and are produced with no such guarantee either implied or actual. Both Wikipedia and Connectsafely.org, along with many more sites that specialize in security, can be accessed via the internet where you will find more information on the subject of passwords and security.
