	<h2>The Green Book</h2>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>The app contains The Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations for construction, (The Green Book).  The app is divided into two parts, the Act, and the Regulations (Regs).  Both parts of the text (the Act and the Regs) have an index which consists of links into the body of the text, there are also links back to the index from within the text. Both parts also have a search window where you can enter a term you are searching for, ladder or guardrail for example.  Pressing the Apply highlight button will cause all instances of the term you are searching for to be highlighted within the section you are in be it the <q>Act</q> or the <q>Regs</q>.  Pressing the <q>Next</q> button will cause the text to scroll down to the next instance of the term you are searching for, the <q>Previous</q> button will cause the scroll to move in the opposite direction.  The <q>Remove Highlight</q> button will remove all highlights, clear the search field, and take you to the top of the index where you can scroll through the index, or begin another search.</p>
	<br>

	<p>The Copy and Paste function as normal and can be used to copy portions of text from either the Act or Regulations and then paste the selected text into another document, an E-Mail for example.</p>
	<br>

	<p>The app functions the same on both Apple and Android devices.  It should be noted that the app is available for both phones, and tablets.  It is important to remember that the app is self contained and there is no need for an internet connection.  Once installed you will have <q>The Green Book</q> on your device and will have access to the text at the top of a 30 floor building or in an underground parking lot.</p>
