			<div class = "small_text1"><p>When you open the app you will be presented with a page which will enable you to navigate the app.</p><br><p>Minutes Count is an app which will allow you to track any number of things and have them connected to a date.  The app is set up to accept job name entries which are unique, therefore if you have two jobs that you would like to call "Fred", refer to one as "Fred", and the second one as "Fred1" for example. There is only one place in the app to delete a job name and is described below.  There are a wide range of things which can be tracked using this app.  You could for example track kilometers per day, be it on a bike, in a car, or on foot.  You may be doing a job where you need to track material cost.  Easy, create a job name, and every time material is purchased enter the information and connect it to the job name you created.  At the end of the job push "View range of dates", enter the start and end date of the job, select the job name and you will have displayed the job name, all the dates you purchased material together with how much the amount of the purchase was, and you will also be given a total.<p>

On Android devices this is done by a long click on the job name you wish to delete, after confirming the job name to be deleted the name and all the data connected with it will be deleted.
